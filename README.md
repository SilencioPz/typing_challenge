<h1 style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; font-family: serif;">A Typing Challenge built in Java, using Swing</h1>

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: serif;">
A simple typing project, made thanks to the website: <a href="https://firstcode.school/java-typing-speed-test/">FirstCode</a>.
<br>
I modified: 
<br>
1) the way the correct words appear to the user, in green. Also, how the incorrect appear in red;
<br>
2) added more phrases, I tried to vary using Tongue Twisters to confuse the user;
<br>
3) a JUnit, that tested 2 typing styles from IntelliJ.
<br>
I loved this project, because I live the Human side of the brain. The complete opposite to Chess Project, that uses lots and lots of Logic...
<br>
I'll sure bring more Human Projects, helping people the best I can! :)
